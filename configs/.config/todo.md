## X11 install 
    Install the X11 header files manually. If you don't want to install
      XQuartz, you can install the X11 header files manually. To do this, you will
      need to download the X11 distribution from the X.Org website. Once you have
      downloaded the distribution, you can extract the header files to a directory
      of your choice.

      Once you have installed the Xlib header files, you should be able to compile
      and run programs that use Xlib.

      Here are the steps to install the Xlib header files manually:

      1. Download the X11 distribution from the X.Org website.
      2. Extract the header files to a directory of your choice.
      3. Add the directory containing the header files to your compiler's include
      path.

      To add the directory to your compiler's include path, you will need to edit
      your compiler's configuration file. The location of the configuration file
      varies depending on your compiler. For example, the configuration file for
      GCC is located at  /usr/local/etc/gcc/conf/gcc.conf .

      Once you have edited the configuration file, you will need to restart your
      computer. After restarting your computer, you should be able to compile and
      run programs that use Xlib.
